  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Effective date: October 15, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Michelle App Marketplace</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) provides automation agents and related services that integrate with third‑party platforms (e.g., Meta products, GitHub, n8n). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal data when you use our apps, websites, and services (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

  <h2>1) Scope</h2>
  <p>This Policy applies to personal data we process as a controller when you interact with our Services, including any Facebook/Meta apps you authorize. When our automations process data on your behalf (e.g., via n8n), we act as your processor and handle data per your instructions.</p>

  <h2>2) Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & Profile Data:</strong> name, email, organization, and settings you provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication & Permissions:</strong> tokens and scopes granted to our app (e.g., Facebook Login permissions, page access tokens).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & Logs:</strong> events, job runs, workflow metadata, IP address, device/browser info, timestamps, and diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Content You Process:</strong> data that your workflows access from connected systems (e.g., posts, comments, messages, files, customer records) strictly to execute the automations you configure.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies & Similar Tech:</strong> small files to keep you signed in, remember preferences, and measure usage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, and secure the Services and automations you configure.</li>
    <li>Authorize integrations with third‑party platforms and maintain tokens securely.</li>
    <li>Troubleshoot, monitor, and improve performance and reliability.</li>
    <li>Communicate about updates, security notices, and support.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Legal Bases</h2>
  <p>We process data as needed to perform a contract with you; with your consent (where required); to pursue legitimate interests (e.g., security, service improvement); and to comply with law.</p>

  <h2>5) Sharing & Disclosures</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers/Processors:</strong> hosting, logging, analytics, support, and automation infrastructure (e.g., n8n, cloud hosts) under contractual safeguards.</li>
    <li><strong>Third‑Party Platforms You Connect:</strong> only as needed to execute your configured workflows and permissions (e.g., Meta APIs, GitHub APIs).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal/Compliance:</strong> if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> during merger, acquisition, or asset sale with appropriate protections.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes above, and delete or anonymize it consistent with our retention policies and legal requirements. Transient workflow data may be cached or logged for reliability and debugging, then purged on a rolling basis.</p>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the risk (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls, secret management, least‑privilege practices). No method is 100% secure; please use strong passwords and keep tokens confidential.</p>

  <h2>8) International Transfers</h2>
  <p>We may process and store data in countries other than your own. Where required, we use lawful mechanisms (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) for cross‑border transfers.</p>

  <h2>9) Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location (e.g., GDPR in the EEA/UK, CCPA/CPRA in California), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, or restrict processing of your personal data, and to object or withdraw consent. To exercise rights, contact us using the details below. We may verify your request.</p>

  <h2>10) Children</h2>
  <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>11) Third‑Party Links & Integrations</h2>
  <p>Our Services may link to or integrate with third‑party sites and APIs. Their practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy. The “Effective date” above shows the latest revision. Material changes will be notified through the Service or by email.</p>
