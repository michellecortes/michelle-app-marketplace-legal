    <li>Respect third‑party platform rules (e.g., Meta, GitHub) and applicable laws, including data protection and anti‑spam laws.</li>
    <li>Do not send sensitive personal data through workflows unless you have a lawful basis and appropriate safeguards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Automations &amp; Integrations</h2>
  <p>Our Services may connect to third‑party platforms (e.g., Meta APIs, n8n, GitHub) per your configuration. You are responsible for the data you route through automations and for maintaining all required rights and consents. We may set reasonable usage limits and rate limiting to protect reliability and compliance.</p>

  <h2>5) Fees</h2>
  <p>If any fees apply, they will be disclosed at purchase or in an order form. Unless stated otherwise, fees are non‑refundable. You authorize us (and our payment processors) to charge your selected payment method for due amounts.</p>

  <h2>6) Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>We and our licensors retain all rights to the Services and related IP. You retain rights to your content and data. Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to use the Services during your subscription or access period.</p>

  <h2>7) Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>Each party may access the other’s confidential information; the receiving party will use it only for legitimate purposes under these Terms and will protect it using reasonable measures.</p>

  <h2>8) Warranties &amp; Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant uninterrupted or error‑free operation or that data loss will not occur.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., via email or in‑app). Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>
