  <h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
  <p class="meta">Updated: October 15, 2025</p>

  <p>If you authorized a Michelle App Marketplace integration and want your personal data deleted, follow the steps below. We will delete your data from our systems and confirm by email.</p>

  <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Email: <a href="mailto:michelled.cortes@icloud.com">michelled.cortes@icloud.com</a></li>
    <li>Subject: <code>Data Deletion Request</code></li>
    <li>Include: your name, the Facebook Page/App you connected, and the email you used (if different).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What we delete</h2>
  <p>We remove account/profile info, tokens/permissions, logs and workflow metadata associated with your account, and any content stored by us for operation of your automations. Transient cache and logs are purged on a rolling basis.</p>

  <h2>Third‑party platforms</h2>
  <p>For data stored in third‑party platforms you connected (e.g., Facebook/Meta, GitHub, n8n self‑host), please follow those platforms’ own deletion processes as we do not control their systems.</p>

  <h2>Verification & timelines</h2>
  <p>We may request information to verify your identity. We aim to complete deletion within 30 days, subject to applicable laws and legitimate retention needs (e.g., fraud prevention, dispute resolution, or legal obligations).</p>
